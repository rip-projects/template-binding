# template-binding

> DEPRECATED: This project already merged to [xin](https://github.com/xinix-technology/xin)

HTML5 already defining `<template>`, unfortunately the spec does not come with template binding capability.

This library works as steroid to `<template>`, to do,

- Render template content to specified element
- Annotate template content to properties
- Bind template content to model object
- Provide getter setter to model object to adapt annotated template content

# Development

```
yarn run build
```
